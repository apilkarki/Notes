The SELECT statement is used to pull information from a table. The general form of the statement is:

SELECT what_to_select
FROM which_table
WHERE conditions_to_satisfy;

To change a single record's field:

mysql> UPDATE <table> SET <field1> = <value1> WHERE <field2> = <value2>;

Some useful queries:

mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE birth >= '1998-1-1';

mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE species = 'dog' AND sex = 'f';

mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE species = 'snake' OR species = 'bird';

AND has higher precedence than OR. If you use both, you should use parenthesis.

mysql> SELECT * FROM pet WHERE (species = 'cat' AND sex = 'm')
    -> OR (species = 'dog' AND sex = 'f');
    

Selecting Particular Columns:

mysql> select <column1>, <column2>, <column3>, .... from <table>;

To only return unique values (no repititions)

mysql> SELECT DISTINCT <field> FROM <table>;

To sort rows Ascending by <field>
mysql> select <field1>, <field2>, ... from <table> order by <field>;

Descending by <field>
mysql> select <field1>, <field2>, ... from <table> order by <field> desc;

To only list the first 10 results:

mysql> select * from <tablename> limit 10






To rename a table/database
mysql> rename [table|database] <table/database name> to <new table/database name>
