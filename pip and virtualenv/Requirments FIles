Requirments files contain lists of PyPI packages along with their version.
For example, a requirments file may contain:

MyApp
Framework==0.9.4
Library>=0.2
..
..
..

If you save these values in a file named requirments.txt, you can run the command

pip install -r requirments.txt

to have pip install the corresponding packages and their versions to set up
your python environment.


To generate a new requirments file, use:

pip freeze > requirments.txt
