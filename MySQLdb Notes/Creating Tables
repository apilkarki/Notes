Because you are beginning with an empty table, an easy way to populate it is to 
create a text file containing a row for each of your animals, then load the contents 
of the file into the table with a single statement.

You could create a text file pet.txt containing one record per line, with values separated 
by tabs, and given in the order in which the columns were listed in the CREATE TABLE statement. 
For missing values (such as unknown sexes or death dates for animals that are still living), you 
can use NULL values. To represent these in your text file, use \N (backslash, capital-N). For 
example, the record for Whistler the bird would look like this (where the whitespace between 
values is a single tab character): 

Whistler        Gwen    bird    \N      1997-12-09      \N

To load the text file pet.txt into the pet table, use this statement:

mysql> LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '/path/pet.txt' INTO TABLE pet;

For CSV files, use the following sed command to replace all commas with tabs:

$ sed -i "s/,/\t\g" <filename>.csv

You could also add a new record using an INSERT statement like this:

mysql> INSERT INTO pet
    -> VALUES ('Puffball','Diane','hamster','f','1999-03-30',NULL);
    
Observe that MySQL expects dates in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format; this may be different from what you are used to.
