mysql> create database if not exists <database name>

To grant privileges to use the database

mysql> grant all on <database name>.* to <mysql username>@<client hostname>

To use a MySql database from the shell (useful for scripting)

$ mysql -u <username> -p <database name>

You can see at any time which database is currently selected using SELECT DATABASE().

How about age? That might be of interest, but it is not a good thing to store in a database. Age changes 
as time passes, which means you'd have to update your records often. Instead, it is better to store a fixed value such as date of birth.
