1) Add the polls app to the mysite/settings.py file, under INSTALLED_APPS.

2) Run a database migration. This creates all the Database tables and schema
from the INSTALLED_APPS and other configuration options.

# ./manage.py migrate

Models
If you make changes to your models (i.e. add new ones)

1) ./manage.py makemigration

The above command creates a database schema using python, located in
polls/migrations

2) ./manage.py migrate

Actually committs the schema to the database (i.e. db.sqlite3)

Models are essentially, your database layout, with additional metadata.
To test your project without making a migration:

./manage.py check

remember the three-step guide to making model changes:

    Change your models (in models.py).
    Run python manage.py makemigrations to create migrations for those changes
    Run python manage.py migrate to apply those changes to the database.
