Change into your projects directory and run the following command.

# django-admin startproject <name_of_project>

# django-admin startproject <name_of_application>

Notice the directory structure that is created.

mysite/
    manage.py
    mysite/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
        
        
1) The outer mysite directory can be named anything. Django doesn't care.

2) manage.py is a command line utility used for interacting with your project.

3) The inner mysite directory is a Python Package (due to the fact it contains
an __init__.py file.

Test the new project by starting the development server

# ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0

Generic

# ./manage.py runserver $IP:$PORT

To run on cloud 9, run on port 8080.
