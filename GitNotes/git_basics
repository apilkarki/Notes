1) create a git repo

git init

2) cloning a git repo (including all commits)

git clone <url> <target repo/directory name>

Git uses a number of different protocols.

https://<url>
git://<path/to/git/repo.git> (which uses SSH)
user@server:<path/to/git/repo.git> (which uses SSH)

3) git diff




To unstage files (if you accidently git add files that should have been added to gitinit)
$ git reset <files_to_be_unstaged>
$ git reset .

If you want to copy files from another repository, you can clone that whole repository first.
$ git clone <Repo-URL> temp-repo
Then copy the desired files as needed.
